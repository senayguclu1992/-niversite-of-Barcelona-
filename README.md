# Seismic Signal Analysis: Barcelona Earthquake Case Study (MATLAB)

This repository includes MATLAB scripts and waveform data from a real M3.8 earthquake event near Pau, France (2013). Originally developed as a research project at Universitat de Barcelona.

## Highlights:
- Signal preprocessing and bandpass filtering
- Spectral analysis (Fourier)
- Rotation of seismic components (Z, N-S, E-W â†’ Z, R, T)
- Visualization of Rayleigh and Love waves

## Tools:
- MATLAB
- IRIS Web Service (for azimuth/distance)

> This project was initially developed in 2018 and adapted for public demonstration.
