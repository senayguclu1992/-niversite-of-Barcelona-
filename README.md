# Barcelona Earthquake Signal Analysis

This project analyzes seismic waveform data from a magnitude 3.8 earthquake near Pau, France (2013).  
It includes MATLAB-based processing such as:

- Signal import and filtering
- Spectral decomposition using FFT
- Component rotation (Z, N-S, E-W → Z, R, T)
- Rayleigh and Love wave identification
- Power and phase spectrum visualization

> Originally developed during a geophysics internship at the University of Barcelona.
